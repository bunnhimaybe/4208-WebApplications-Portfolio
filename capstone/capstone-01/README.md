## Task
For the first capstone milestone, students were required to form project teams. Each student maintains an individual repository that links to their group projects, which are hosted in separate team repositories. This initial phase focused on establishing teams, forking the provided portfolio template, and setting up the repository structure in preparation for future milestones.
